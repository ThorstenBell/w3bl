Hi, I’m Thorsten, a freelance web developer and graphic designer passionate about helping brands grow through smart,
visually striking, and user-friendly digital experiences.

Whether you’re a small business owner, startup founder, or creative professional, I create websites that don’t just look
great — they get results. My goal is to build your online presence around what matters most: your brand, your goals, and
your audience.

With a strong background in modern front-end development and graphic design, I handle every stage of your online
presence — from concept and layout to launch and optimization. That means you get cohesive, consistent design and
functionality, all from one dedicated professional.
